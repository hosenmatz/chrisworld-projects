# Check that you dont' have a firewall blocking ports on your computer
# Must match part Processing is sending OSC message with
PORT = 2014  # ;) 

# Most be set to same IP as localhost
HOST = "10.0.0.2"

# Blender Must have the OSC module installed
# you can either include each file into the text portions of blender
# or drop the OSC module files into the blender.app/Contents/MacOS/.blender/scripts folder
